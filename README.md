# Agentic Predictive Maintenance for Insured Assets
---
**Objective:** Develop an agentic predictive maintenance solution using time-series sensor data.

**Core Components:**
* **Data:** Time-series sensor data, policy data, and maintenance logs/manuals.
* **Model:** Time-aware model selection (forecasting/classification) and hyperparameter tuning.
* **Agent:** An AI agent combining deterministic checks, RAG (retrieval from manuals), and LLM reasoning to provide explainable maintenance recommendations.
